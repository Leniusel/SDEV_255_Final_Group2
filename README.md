This is the project repo for group 2.

The OldFile directory consist of the concept and design code. Everyone in the group submitted a piece of the code and we integrated the pieces together. The prototype console program can be found here (finalized_project.py and pw_manager.db). Once the logic was approved, we integrated it to a GUI.

The wip_GUI directory is where the code for the system is stored. It contains the application's main python file, asset, data, and fonts folders. To run the GUI python code, you will need to download this folder and check if your system has installed tkinter, PIL, and pyglet.
Use pip -V in your command prompt to see check which Python version you have. If it is before python3, you need to update since python3 includes the sqlite3 module. 

You can run the following commands in the Command Prompt (if you have already installed, your system will tell you):
* pip install tk
* pip install Pillow
* pip install --upgrade --user https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet/archive/master.zip

The SKS_Download directory is where the final product is located. Instructions on how to use the app and the download page is here.
